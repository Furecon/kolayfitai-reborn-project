  # Optimize RLS Policies for Performance

  This migration optimizes Row Level Security policies to avoid re-evaluating 
  auth.uid() for each row. Instead, it uses (select auth.uid()) which is 
  evaluated once per query, significantly improving performance at scale.

  ## Changes

  All RLS policies are updated to use (select auth.uid()) instead of auth.uid():
  
  1. **favorites table** - 4 policies optimized
  2. **sync_queue table** - 1 policy optimized
  3. **notifications table** - 1 policy optimized
  4. **user_preferences table** - 3 policies optimized
  5. **subscriptions table** - 3 policies optimized
  6. **ai_analysis table** - 1 policy optimized
  7. **profiles table** - 3 policies optimized
  8. **meal_logs table** - 4 policies optimized
  9. **ai_assessments table** - 2 policies optimized
  10. **scanned_products table** - 2 policies optimized
  11. **favorite_products table** - 4 policies optimized
  12. **meal_suggestions table** - 2 policies optimized
  13. **favorite_meals table** - 4 policies optimized
  14. **analysis_cache table** - 4 policies optimized
  15. **daily_goals table** - 3 policies optimized
  16. **ai_chat_history table** - 2 policies optimized
  17. **custom_recipes table** - 1 policy optimized

  ## Performance Impact
  - Auth function evaluated once per query instead of per row
  - Significant performance improvement for queries returning many rows
  - Reduced CPU usage on database
